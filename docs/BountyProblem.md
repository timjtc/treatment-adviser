BOUNTY 5000: AI-Powered Treatment Plan Assistant

## Mission Brief

- Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build an AI-powered clinical assistant that turns patient intake data and medical history into a **personalized, safety-checked treatment plan**.

- This tool should help doctors make faster, data-driven decisions while **flagging drug interactions, contraindications, and risk factors**—not replacing clinicians, but supercharging them. 

## Inputs
Design a patient intake flow that captures at least:

- Medical history (conditions, allergies)
- Current medications (drug name, dosage, frequency)
- Health metrics (age, weight, BMI, blood pressure)
- Lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, exercise)
- Primary complaint (e.g. ED, hair loss, weight loss)

You may hardcode sample patients or build a live form, as long as the flow is clear. 

## Core Logic
Use an LLM API (e.g. GPT / Claude / Gemini) with medical guidelines encoded in the system prompt.
The model must:
- Check for drug–drug interactions
- Check for contraindications from conditions/allergies
- Check dosage appropriateness and basic risk factors
- Produce structured, parseable output (e.g. JSON schema).
- Extra credit for using structured medical databases (drug interaction rules contraindications) to validate or enrich the LLM output.

## Expected Output / UX
Build a clinical decision support dashboard that surfaces:

1. Recommended treatment plan (medication, dosage, duration)
2. Safety risk score (e.g. Low / Medium / High)
3. Flagged contraindications or drug interactions
4. Alternative treatment options
5. Explanation / rationale for each recommendation

Design for busy doctors: show critical risks first, then details and rationale. The UI should make it easy to approve, modify, or reject the plan.

## To Complete This Bounty
To count as "solved", your submission must include:

- A working intake flow that collects the required patient data.
- At least one LLM integration using medical rules in the system prompt.
- Structured output (e.g. JSON) with: treatment plan, risk level, and rationale.
- A basic dashboard UI that:
    - Displays the treatment plan
    - Shows a safety risk indicator
    - Lists any flagged issues (contraindications / interactions).
- At least one realistic example patient that demonstrates risks being flagged.

## Bonus / Advanced
Bonus points (not required, but strongly valued):

- Implement a JSON schema for the LLM’s response and validate against it.
- Use a drug interaction / contraindication database (PostgreSQL, API, etc.) to cross-check model output.
- Build a multi-step wizard:
- Intake → AI analysis → Doctor review/edit → Final summary.
- Add confidence scores per recommendation and alternative treatment paths.
- Include audit logging for medical compliance (who reviewed what, when).

## Additional Details
- Safety > everything:
    - Always flag high-risk cases aggressively; false positives are better than misses.
- Prompting:
    - Encode dosing rules, contraindications, and interaction rules directly in your system prompts.
- 24h feasibility:
    - Start with a simple form → LLM call → text/JSON display.
    - You don’t need a complex backend; the LLM can handle most of the medical logic.
- UX guidelines:
    - Show red/orange/green risk indicators.
    - Make the "why" behind recommendations easy to see (short rationales).
